# Phase 5: Polish & Scale

**Timeline:** Month 5+

**Objective:** Production-ready for consulting clients

---

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] WebGL rendering for >5,000 nodes (deck.gl integration)
- [ ] Level-of-detail (LOD) system (hide labels at zoom-out)
- [ ] Lazy loading (load hierarchy on expand, not upfront)
- [ ] IndexedDB caching (cache graph data client-side)
- [ ] Service worker (offline support, PWA)

---

## Mobile/Tablet Support

- [ ] Touch-optimized controls (pinch zoom, swipe pan)
- [ ] Responsive layout (stack panels vertically on mobile)
- [ ] Simplified mobile UI (fewer visible nodes)
- [ ] Mobile-first search (full-screen modal on tap)

---

## Accessibility (WCAG AAA)

- [ ] Full keyboard navigation (tab through nodes, arrow keys expand)
- [ ] Screen reader support (ARIA labels, live regions)
- [ ] High-contrast mode toggle
- [ ] Focus indicators (visible keyboard focus)
- [ ] Skip to content links

---

## Internationalization

- [ ] Multi-language support (English, Spanish, French, Mandarin)
- [ ] Translate indicator names (use original dataset translations)
- [ ] RTL layout support (Arabic, Hebrew)

---

## White-Label Customization (for consulting)

- [ ] Custom branding (upload logo, set color palette)
- [ ] Custom data (upload your own graph structure)
- [ ] Custom scenarios (pre-load client-specific interventions)
- [ ] Private hosting (client-specific subdomains)

---

## Deliverables

- [ ] WebGL renderer (`WebGLGlobalView.jsx`)
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native or PWA)
- [ ] Accessibility audit report (WCAG AAA compliance)
- [ ] i18n system (react-i18next integration)
- [ ] White-label configuration portal

---

## Success Metrics

- [ ] 1+ white-label client
- [ ] Mobile app downloads >500
- [ ] WCAG AAA compliance
